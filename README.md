# FriendFinder

## Purpose
This app prompts users to fill out answers to predictive questions to find friends in our database based on similarity of responses. We have chosen ten of our best questions to allow users a quick and easy-to-use interface to find new friends.

## Technology
We use heroku and the node.js express library to  provide users with an online app to use our service and house our api.

Javascript allows us to quickly compare user's answers to our survey and match them to our friend's database for compatibility.
